# Perceptron
This project was created as a response to Luis Serrano's [logistic regression and perceptron alrogithm video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbluHIgBmBo). I tried to use the same terminology that was used in the video (eg. red and blue points), so it would be easier to see how the ideas in the video can be represented as code.

## Example
This example shows the line before and after training. The initial line is -7 - 3y - 6 = 0
